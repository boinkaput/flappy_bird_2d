# Flappy Bird

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Python. The game is built using the Pygame library and can be installed and run on your local machine.

## Installation

To install the game, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```shell
./install
```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command in your terminal:
```shell
python3 flappy_bird.py
```

Once the game is running, use the spacebar or up arrow key to control the bird's flight. The objective is to navigate the bird through gaps between pipes by tapping the spacebar or up arrow key to make the bird jump. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or if it falls to the ground.

## Dependencies

The game requires the following dependencies:
- Python3
- Pygame
- RecordType
